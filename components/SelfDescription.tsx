      I am a front-end developer based in Galway, Ireland. I write about
      technology, finance, investments and my thoughts about the shape that tech
      industry will take in our lifetime. I hope you will love to come along
      with me on my journey.

      I also document my journey across the world through amazing photos which
      you can view or even buy as NFTs!
